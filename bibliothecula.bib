	abstract = {Sensory experience and perceptual learning changes the receptive field properties of cortical pyramidal neurons, largely mediated by long-term potentiation ({LTP}) of synapses. The circuit mechanisms underlying cortical {LTP} remain unclear. In the mouse somatosensory cortex (S1), {LTP} can be elicited in layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons by rhythmic whisker stimulation. We combined electrophysiology, optogenetics, and chemogenetics in thalamocortical slices to dissect the synaptic circuitry underlying this {LTP}. We found that projections from higher-order, posteriormedial thalamic complex ({POm}) to S1 are key to eliciting {NMDAR}-dependent {LTP} of intracortical synapses. Paired activation of intracortical and higher-order thalamocortical pathways increased vasoactive intestinal peptide ({VIP}) interneuron and decreased somatostatin ({SST}) interneuron activity, which was critical for inducing {LTP}. Our results reveal a novel circuit motif in which higher-order thalamic feedback gates plasticity of intracortical synapses in S1 via disinhibition. This motif may allow contextual feedback to shape synaptic circuits that process first-order sensory information.},

However, their organizational principle remains unclear. By using a retrograde labeling system, we deﬁned the requirement of {CSNs} in the execution of a skilled forelimb food-pellet retrieval task in mice. In vivo imaging of {CSN} activity during performance revealed the sequential activation of topographically ordered functional ensembles with moderate local mixing. Region-speciﬁc manipulations indicate that {CSNs} from caudal or rostral forelimb area control reaching or grasping, respectively, and both are required in the transitional pronation step. These region-speciﬁc {CSNs} terminate in different spinal levels and locations, therefore preferentially connecting with the premotor neurons of muscles engaged in different steps of the task. Together, our ﬁndings suggest that spatially deﬁned groups of {CSNs} encode different movement modules	, providing a logic for parallel-ordered corticospinal circuits to orchestrate multistep motor skills.},

	abstract = {Through {GABAergic} ﬁbers, globus pallidus ({GP}) coordinates basal ganglia global function. Electrical activity of {GP} neurons depends on their membrane properties and afferent ﬁbers, including {GABAergic} ﬁbers from striatum. In pathological conditions, abnormal electrical activity of {GP} neurons is associated with motor deﬁcits. There is a {GABAergic} pathway from the {GP} to the reticular thalamic nucleus ({RTn}) whose contribution to {RTn} neurons electrical activity has received little attention. This fact called our attention because the {RTn} controls the overall information ﬂow of thalamic nuclei to cerebral cortex. Here, we study the spontaneous electrical activity of {RTn} neurons recorded in vivo in anesthetized rats and under pharmacological activation or inhibition of the {GP}. We found that activation of {GP} predominantly diminishes the spontaneous {RTn} neurons ﬁring rate and its inhibition increases their ﬁring rate; however, both activation and inhibition of {GP} did not modi	ﬁed the burst index ({BI}) or the coefﬁcient of variation ({CV}) of {RTn} neurons. Moreover, stimulation of striatum predominantly diminishes the spiking rate of {GP} cells and increases the spiking rate in {RTn} neurons without modifying the {BI} or {CV} in reticular neurons. Our data suggest a {GP} tight control over {RTn} spiking activity.},

Investigating the neural control of movement in general, and the cortical control of volitional arm movements in particular, has been a major research focus in recent decades. Studies have involved primarily either attempts to account for single-neuron responses in terms of tuning for movement parameters or attempts to decode movement parameters from populations of tuned neurons. Even though this focus on encoding and decoding has led to many seminal advances, it has not produced an agreed-upon conceptual framework. Interest in understanding the underlying neural dynamics has recently increased, leading to questions such as how does the current population response determine the future population response, and to what purpose? We review how a dynamical systems perspective may help us understand why neural activity evolves the way it does, how neural activity relates to movement parameters, and how a uniﬁed conceptual framework may result.},

Rats and mice actively move these whiskers during exploration.The neuronal mechanisms controlling whisker movements and the sensory representation of whisker tactile information are widely studied as a model for sensorimotor processing in mammals. Studies of the natural whisker movement patterns during exploration and tactile examination are still in their early stages. Tracking the movements of whiskers is technically challenging as they move relatively fast and are very thin, particularly in mice. Existing systems detect light-beam interruptions by the whiskers or use high-speed video to track whisker movements in one or two-dimensions. Here we describe a method for tracking the movements of mouse whiskers in three-dimensions (3D) using optical motion capture technology ({OMCT}). {OMCT} tracks the movements of small retro-reflective markers attached to whiskers of a head-fixed mouse 	with a spatial resolution of {\textless}0.5 mm in all 3D and a temporal resolution of 5 ms (200 fps). The system stores the 3D coordinates of the marker’s trajectories onto hard disk allowing a detailed analysis of movement trajectories bilateral coordination. The described method currently uses the minimum of two tracking cameras, which requires head-fixation for reliable tracking.},

	abstract = {Uncovering common principles by which diverse modalities of information are processed is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. In mammalian brain, thalamus is the central processing station for inputs from sensory systems, subcortical motor systems, and cortex; a function subserved by over 30 defined nuclei. Multiple thalamic nuclei send convergent information to each region of the forebrain, but whether there is a conserved architecture across the set of thalamic pathways projecting to each forebrain area has remained unresolved. To uncover organizational principles of thalamic pathways, we produced a near-comprehensive transcriptomic atlas of thalamus. This revealed a common logic for thalamic nuclei serving all major cortical modalities. We found that almost all nuclei belong to one of three major profiles, with a given cortical area getting input from each of these profiles. These profiles lie on a single axis of variance aligned with the mediolateral axis of thalamus, and this axis is strongly 	enriched in genes encoding receptors and ion channels. We further show that each projection profile exhibits different electrophysiological signatures. Single-cell profiling revealed that rather than forming discrete classes, thalamic neurons lie on a spectrum, with intermediate cells existing between profiles. Thus, in contrast to canonical models of thalamus that suggest it is a switchboard primarily concerned with routing distinct modalities of information to distinct cortical regions, we show that the thalamocortical system is more akin to a molecularly-defined filter bank repeatedly applied across modality. Together, we reveal striking covariation in the organization of thalamic pathways serving all input modalities and output targets, establishing a simple and comprehensive thalamic functional architecture.},

	abstract = {The motor cortex is far from a stable conduit for motor commands and instead undergoes signiﬁcant changes during learning. An understanding of motor cortex plasticity has been advanced greatly using rodents as experimental animals. Two major focuses of this research have been on the connectivity and activity of the motor cortex. The motor cortex exhibits structural changes in response to learning, and substantial evidence has implicated the local formation and maintenance of new synapses as crucial substrates of motor learning. This synaptic reorganization translates into changes in spiking activity, which appear to result in a modiﬁcation and reﬁnement of the relationship between motor cortical activity and movement. This review presents the progress that has been made using rodents to establish the motor cortex as an adaptive structure that supports motor learning.},

Nonetheless, the way cerebellar information is integrated with motor cortical commands and affects their temporal properties remains unclear. To address this issue, we activated the {CTC} system in primates and found that it efﬁciently recruits motor cortical cells; however, the cortical response was dominated by prolonged inhibition that imposed a directional activation across the motor cortex. During task performance, cortical cells that integrated {CTC} information ﬁred synchronous bursts at movement onset. These cells expressed a stronger correlation with reaction time than {nonCTC} cells. Thus, the excitation-inhibition interplay triggered by the {CTC} system facilitates transient recruitment of a cortical subnetwork at movement onset. The {CTC} system may shape neural ﬁring to produce the required proﬁle to initiate mo	vements and thus plays a pivotal role in timing motor actions.},

Cross correlation analysis showed patterns consistent with synaptic excitation and/or inhibition between members of the cell pairs during the voluntary movement. The strength of correlation was inversely related to distance between columns, with the strongest correlations found between cells within the same column. Inhibitory correlations were virtually restricted to cell pairs within a single column. Temporal analysis showed that direct synaptic interaction and shared input patterns could be clearly distinguished in this physiologic setting. Spatial analysis indicated that shared input was concentrated among columns in the 	same and adjacent joint controlling zones as well as within a single column. No directional preference of shared input was present, a finding which was consistent with the observed nested organization of the forelimb area.},

After 24 h of stimulation with 15-ms blue light pulses every 90 s, dendritic spine density was reduced in the {CA}1 region of mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 ({ChR}2) when compared to controls. This protocol also impaired the induction of {LTP} and facilitated that of {LTD} in ex vivo slices obtained from {ChR}2-expressing mice immediately after the end of stimulation.

Yet, when and how motor cortex inﬂuences muscle activity during movement execution remains unresolved. We addressed this ambiguity using measurement and perturbation of motor cortical activity together with electromyography in mice during two forelimb movements that differ in their requirement for cortical involvement. Rapid optogenetic silencing and electrical stimulation indicated that short-latency pathways linking motor cortex with spinal motor neurons are selectively activated during one behavior. Analysis of motor cortical activity revealed a dramatic change between behaviors in the coordination of ﬁring patterns across neurons that could account for this differential inﬂuence. Thus, our results suggest that changes in motor cortical output patterns enable a behaviorally selective engagement of short-latency effector pathways. The model of motor cortical inﬂuence im	plied by our ﬁndings helps reconcile previous observations on the function of motor cortex.},

Over learning, the sequential activity across cortical modules became temporally more compressed, and its trial-by-trial variability decreased. Moreover, a new ﬂow of activity emerged during learning, originating from premotor cortex (M2), and M2 became predictive of the activity of many other modules. Inactivation experiments showed that M2 is critical for the post-learning dynamics in the cortex-wide activity. Furthermore, two-photon calcium imaging revealed that M2 ensemble activity also showed earlier activity onset and reduced variability with learning, which was accompanied by changes in the activity-movement relationship. These results reveal newly emergent properties of macroscopic cortical dyn	amics during motor learning and highlight the importance of M2 in controlling learned movements.},

Here we revisit these two conflicting views of motor cortex and present a new behaviour assay, challenging animals to respond to unexpected situations while navigating a dynamic obstacle course.
	Surprisingly, rats with motor cortical lesions show clear impairments facing an unexpected collapse of the obstacles, while showing no impairment with repeated trials in many motor and cognitive metrics of performance. We propose a new role for motor cortex: extending the robustness of sub-cortical movement systems, specifically to unexpected situations demanding rapid motor responses adapted to environmental context. The implications of this idea for current and future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {The somatosensory and motor systems are intricately linked, providing several routes for the sensorimotor interactions necessary for haptic processing. Here, we used electrical and optogenetic stimulation to study the circuits that enable primary motor cortex (M1) to exert top-down modulation of whisker-evoked responses, at the levels of brain stem, thalamus and somatosensory cortex (S1). We find that activation of M1 drives somatosensory responsive cells at all levels, and that this excitation is followed by a period of tactile suppression, which gradually increases in strength along the ascending somatosensory pathway. Using optogenetic stimulation in the layer-specific Cre driver lines, we find that activation of layer {VI} cortico-thalamic neurons is sufficient to drive spiking in higher order thalamus, and that this is reliably followed by excitation of S1, suggesting a cross-modal cortico-thalamo-cortical pathway. Cortico-thalamic excitation predicts the degree of subsequent tactile suppression, consistent with a strong role for thalamic circuits in the expression of inhibitory sensorimotor interactions. These results provide evidence of a role for M1 in dynamic modulation of S1, largely under cortico-thalamic control.},

Point mutation of Ile170 of {ChEF} to Val (yielding ‘‘{ChIEF}’’) accelerates the rate of channel closure while retaining reduced inactivation, leading to more consistent responses when stimulated above 25 Hz in both {HEK}293 cells and cultured hippocampal neurons. In addition, these variants have altered spectral responses, light sensitivity, and channel selectivity. {ChEF} and {ChIEF} allow more p	recise temporal control of depolarization, and can induce action potential trains that more closely resemble natural spiking patterns.},

This review explores to what extent descending pathways are highly conserved across species and concludes that there are actually rather widespread species differences, for example, in the transmission of information from the corticospinal tract to upper limb motoneurons. The signiﬁcance of direct, corticomotoneuronal ({CM}) connections, which were discovered a little more than 50 years ago, is reassessed. I conclude that although these connections operate in parallel with other less direct linkages to motoneurons, {CM} inﬂuence is signiﬁcant and may subserve some special functions including adaptive motor behaviors involvin	g the distal extremities.},

Short-term memories are correlated with selective persistent activity, which can be maintained over seconds. In a delayed response task that requires short-term memory, neurons in mouse anterior lateral motor cortex ({ALM}) show persistent activity that instructs future actions. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this persistent activity we combined intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology with optogenetic perturbations and network modeling. During the delay epoch, both membrane potential and population activity of {ALM} neurons funneled towards discrete endpoints related to specific movement directions. These endpoints were robust to transient shifts in {ALM} activity caused by optogenetic perturbations. Perturbations occasionally switched the population dynamics to the other endpoint, followed by incorrect actions. Our results are consistent with discrete attractor dynamics underlying shor		t-term memory related to motor planning.},

The thalamic reticular nucleus ({TRN}) is hypothesized to regulate thalamo-cortical interactions, but the underlying functional architecture of this process and its state dependence are unknown. By combining the ﬁrst {TRN} ensemble recording with psychophysics and connectivity-based optogenetic tagging, we found reticular circuits to be composed of distinct subnetworks. While activity of limbic-projecting {TRN} neurons positively correlates with arousal, sensoryprojecting neurons participate in spindles and show elevated synchrony by slow waves during sleep. Sensory-projecting neurons are suppressed by attentional states, demonstrating that their gating of thalamo-cortical interactions is matched to behavioral state. Bidirectional manipulation of attentional performance was achieved through subnetwork-speciﬁc optogenetic stimulation. Together, our ﬁndings provi	de evidence for differential inhibition of thalamic nuclei across brain states, where the {TRN} separately controls external sensory and internal limbic processing facilitating normal cognitive function.},

	abstract = {Electrical and pharmacological stimulation methods are commonly used to study neuronal brain circuits in vivo, but are problematic, because electrical stimulation has limited specificity, while pharmacological activation has low temporal resolution. A recently developed alternative to these methods is the use of optogenetic techniques, based on the expression of light sensitive channel proteins in neurons. While optogenetics have been applied in in vitro preparations and in in vivo studies in rodents, their use to study brain function in nonhuman primates has been limited to the cerebral cortex. Here, we characterize the effects of channelrhodopsin-2 ({ChR}2) transfection in subcortical areas, i.e., the putamen, the external globus pallidus ({GPe}) and the ventrolateral thalamus ({VL}) of rhesus monkeys. Lentiviral vectors containing the {ChR}2 sequence under control of the elongation factor 1a promoter ({pLenti}-{EF}1a -{hChR}2(H134R)-{eYFP}-{WPRE}, titer 109 particles/ ml) were deposited in {GP	e}, putamen and {VL}. Four weeks later, a probe combining a conventional electrode and an optic fiber was introduced in the previously injected brain areas. We found light-evoked responses in 31.5\% and 32.7\% of all recorded neurons in the striatum and thalamus, respectively, but only in 2.5\% of recorded {GPe} neurons. As expected, most responses were time-locked increases in firing, but decreases or mixed responses were also seen, presumably via {ChR}2mediated activation of local inhibitory connections. Light and electron microscopic analyses revealed robust expression of {ChR}2 on the plasma membrane of cell somas, dendrites, spines and terminals in the striatum and {VL}. This study demonstrates that optogenetic experiments targeting the striatum and basal ganglia-related thalamic nuclei can be successfully achieved in monkeys. Our results indicate important differences of the type and magnitude of responses in each structure. Experimental conditions such as the vector used, the number and rate of inject	ions, or the light stimulation conditions have to be optimized for each structure studied.},

Volitional control, however, entails the initiation of movements and the ability to suppress undesired movements.

	abstract = {We developed a biologically detailed multiscale model of mouse primary motor cortex (M1) microcircuits, incorporating data from several recent experimental studies. The model simulates at scale a cylindrical volume with a diameter of 300 m and cortical depth 1350 m of M1. It includes over 10,000 cells distributed across cortical layers based on measured cell densities, with close to 30 million synaptic connections. Neuron models were optimized to reproduce electrophysiological properties of major classes of M1 neurons. Layer 5 corticospinal and corticostriatal neuron morphologies with 700+ compartments reproduced cell 3D reconstructions, and their ionic channel distributions were optimized within experimental constraints to reproduce in vitro recordings. The network was driven by the main long-range inputs to M1: posterior nucleus ({PO}) and ventrolateral ({VL}) thalamus {PO}, primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (S1, S2), contralateral M1, secondary motor cortex (M2), and orbital cortex 	({OC}). The network local and long-range connections depended on pre- and post-synaptic cell class and cortical depth. Data was based on optogenetic circuit mapping studies which determined that connection strengths vary within layer as a function of the neuron's cortical depth. The synaptic input distribution across cell dendritic trees -- likely to subserve important neural coding functions -- was also mapped using optogenetic methods and incorporated into the model. We employed the model to study the effect on M1 of increased activity from each of the long-range inputs, and of different levels of H-current in pyramidal tract-projecting ({PT}) corticospinal neurons. Microcircuit dynamics and information flow were quantified using firing rates, oscillations, and information transfer measures (Granger causality and normalized transfer entropy). Simulation results support the hypothesis that M1 operates along a continuum of modes characterized by the degree of activation of intratelencephalic ({IT}), corticot	halamic ({CT}) and {PT} neurons. The particular subset of M1 neurons targeted by different long-range inputs and the level of H-current in {PT} neurons regulated the different modes. Downregulation of H-current facilitated synaptic integration of inputs and increased {PT} output activity. Therefore, {VL}, {cM}1 and M2 inputs with downregulated H-current promoted an {PT}-predominant mode; whereas {PO}, S1 and S2 inputs with upregulated H-current favored an {IT}/{CT}-predominant mode, but a mixed mode where upper layer {IT} cells in turn activated {PT} cells if H-current was downregulated. This evidenced two different pathways that can generate corticospinal output: motor-related inputs bypassing upper M1 layers and directly projecting to {PT} cells, and sensory-related inputs projecting to superficial {IT} neurons in turn exciting {PT} cells. These findings provide a hypothetical mechanism to translate action planning into action execution. Overall, our model serves as an extensible framework to combine exper	imental data at multiple scales and perform in silico experiments that help us understand M1 microcircuit dynamics, information flow and biophysical mechanisms, and potentially develop treatments for motor disorders.},

In this video, we first describe the behaviors of mice that are commonly encountered in this learning and memory paradigm, and then discuss how to categorize these behaviors and quantify the observed results.

	abstract = {Motor thalamus (Mthal) is implicated in the control of movement because it is strategically located between motor areas of the cerebral cortex and motor-related subcortical structures, such as the cerebellum and basal ganglia ({BG}). The role of {BG} and cerebellum in motor control has been extensively studied but how Mthal processes inputs from these two networks is unclear. Speciﬁcally, there is considerable debate about the role of {BG} inputs on Mthal activity. This review summarizes anatomical and physiological knowledge of the Mthal and its afferents and reviews current theories of Mthal function by discussing the impact of cortical, {BG} and cerebellar inputs on Mthal activity. One view is that Mthal activity in {BG} and cerebellar-receiving territories is primarily “driven” by glutamatergic inputs from the cortex or cerebellum, respectively, whereas {BG} inputs are modulatory and do not strongly determine Mthal activity. This theory is steeped in the assumption that the Mthal processes in	formation in the same way as sensory thalamus, through interactions of modulatory inputs with a single driver input. Another view, from {BG} models, is that {BG} exert primary control on the {BG}-receiving Mthal so it effectively relays information from {BG} to cortex. We propose a new “super-integrator” theory where each Mthal territory processes multiple driver or driver-like inputs (cortex and {BG}, cortex and cerebellum), which are the result of considerable integrative processing. Thus, {BG} and cerebellar Mthal territories assimilate motivational and proprioceptive motor information previously integrated in cortico-{BG} and cortico-cerebellar networks, respectively, to develop sophisticated motor signals that are transmitted in parallel pathways to cortical areas for optimal generation of motor programmes. Finally, we brieﬂy review the pathophysiological changes that occur in the {BG} in parkinsonism and generate testable hypotheses about how these may affect processing of inputs in the Mthal.},

	abstract = {The process by which neural circuitry in the brain plans and executes movements is not well understood. Until recently, most available data were limited either to single-neuron electrophysiological recordings or to measures of aggregate ﬁeld or metabolism. Neither approach reveals how individual neurons’ activities are coordinated within the population, and thus inferences about how the neural circuit forms a motor plan for an upcoming movement have been indirect. Here we build on recent advances in the measurement and description of population activity to frame and test an ‘‘initial condition hypothesis’’ of arm movement preparation and initiation. This hypothesis leads to a model in which the timing of movements may be predicted on each trial using neurons’ moment-by-moment ﬁring rates and rates of change of those rates. Using simultaneous microelectrode array recordings from premotor cortex of monkeys performing delayed-reach movements, we compare such single-trial predictions to those of othe	r theories. We show that our model can explain approximately 4-fold more arm-movement reaction-time variance than the best alternative method. Thus, the initial condition hypothesis elucidates a view of the relationship between single-trial preparatory neural population dynamics and single-trial behavior.},

The neurophysiological evidence supports both perspectives. This chapter surveys some of that evidence, with particular focus on the latter, more ‘traditional’, role of motor cortex.},

We used ‘‘slow’’ {ChR}2 variants with mutations in the C128 residue, that exhibit delayed offkinetics and increased light sensitivity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Following a 1 s light pulse, we could photodepolarize neurons and muscles for minutes (and with repeated brief stimulation, up to days) with low-intensity light. Photoactivation of {ChR}2(C128S) in command interneurons elicited long-lasting alterations in locomotion. Finally, we could optically induce profound changes in animal development: Long-term photoactivation of {ASJ} neurons, which regulate larval growth, bypassed the constitutive entry into the ‘‘dauer’’ larval state in daf-11 mutants. These lack a guanylyl cyclase, which possibly renders {ASJ} neur	ons hyperpolarized. Furthermore, photostimulated {ASJ} neurons could acutely trigger dauer-exit. Thus, slow {ChR}2s can be employed to long-term photoactivate behavior and to trigger alternative animal development.},

The recent development of optogenetics, because of its unprecedented precision for controlling activity within distinct neuronal populations, has revolutionized neuroscience, including epilepsy research. This Review discusses recent breakthroughs made with optogenetics in epilepsy research. These breakthroughs include new insights into the key roles that different cell types play in mediating seizures as well as in the development of epilepsy. Subsequently, we discuss how targeting different brain regions and cell populations has opened up the possibility of highly speciﬁc therapies that can stop seizures on demand. Finally, we illustrate how combining newly available neuroscience tools with whole-brain imaging techniques will allow researchers to understand better the sprea	d of seizures on a network level. {VC} 2016 The Authors.

However, our current understanding of seizure dynamics is still limited. Here we propose a novel in vivo model of seizure-like afterdischarges using optogenetics, and report on investigation of directional network dynamics during seizure along the septo-temporal ({ST}) axis of hippocampus. Repetitive pulse photostimulation was applied to the rodent hippocampus, in which channelrhodopsin-2 ({ChR}2) was expressed, under simultaneous recording of local field potentials ({LFPs}). Seizure-like afterdischarges were successfully induced after the stimulation in both W-{TChR}2V4 transgenic ({ChR}2V-{TG}) rats and in wild type rats transfected with adeno-associated virus ({AAV}) vectors carrying {ChR}2. Pulse frequency at 10 and 20 Hz, and a 0.05 duty ratio were optimal for afterdischarge induction. Immunohistochemical c-Fos staining after a single induced afterdischarge 	confirmed neuronal activation of the entire hippocampus. {LFPs} were recorded during seizure-like afterdischarges with a multi-contact array electrode inserted along the {ST} axis of hippocampus. Granger causality analysis of the {LFPs} showed a bidirectional but asymmetric increase in signal flow along the {ST} direction. State space presentation of the causality and coherence revealed three discrete states of the seizure-like afterdischarge phenomenon: 1) resting state; 2) afterdischarge initiation with moderate coherence and dominant septal-to-temporal causality; and 3) afterdischarge termination with increased coherence and dominant temporal-to-septal causality. A novel in vivo model of seizure-like afterdischarge was developed using optogenetics, which was advantageous in its reproducibility and artifact-free electrophysiological observations. Our results provide additional evidence for the potential role of hippocampal septo-temporal interactions in seizure dynamics in vivo. Bidirectional networks work 	hierarchically along the {ST} hippocampus in the genesis and termination of epileptic seizures.},

	abstract = {Interactions between distinct motor cortical areas are essential for coordinated motor behaviors. In rodents, the motor cortical forelimb areas are divided into at least two distinct areas: the rostral forelimb area ({RFA}) and the caudal forelimb area ({CFA}). The {RFA} is thought to be an equivalent of the premotor cortex ({PM}) in primates, whereas the {CFA} is believed to be an equivalent of the primary motor cortex. Although reciprocal connections between the {RFA} and the {CFA} have been anatomically identiﬁed in rats, it is unknown whether there are functional connections between these areas that can induce postsynaptic spikes. In this study, we used an in vivo Channelrhodopsin-2 ({ChR}2) photostimulation method to trace the functional connections between the mouse {RFA} and {CFA}. Simultaneous electrical recordings were utilized to detect spiking activities induced by synaptic inputs originating from photostimulated areas. This method, in combination with anatomical tracing, demonstrated 	that the {RFA} receives strong functional projections from layer 2/3 and/or layer 5a, but not from layer 5b (L5b), of the {CFA}. Further, the {CFA} receives strong projections from L5b neurons of the {RFA}. The onset latency of electrical responses evoked in remote areas upon photostimulation of the other areas was approximately 10 ms, which is consistent with the synaptic connectivity between these areas. Our results suggest that neuronal activities in the {RFA} and the {CFA} during movements are formed through asymmetric reciprocal connections.},

	abstract = {Neuroscience has focused on the detailed implementation of computation, studying neural codes, dynamics and circuits. In machine learning, however, artiﬁcial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) the cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a 	pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. In support of these hypotheses, we argue that a range of implementations of credit assignment through multiple layers of neurons are compatible with our current knowledge of neural circuitry, and that the brain’s specialized systems can be interpreted as enabling efﬁcient optimization for speciﬁc problem classes. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efﬁcient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to reﬁne and test these hypotheses.},

Barrel cortex axons preferentially targeted upper layer (L2/3, L5A) neurons in motor cortex; input to neurons projecting back to barrel cortex was particularly strong. Barrel cortex input to deeper layers (L5B, L6) of motor cortex, including neurons projecting to the brainstem, was weak, despite pronounced geometric overlap of dendrites with axons from barrel cortex. Neurons in different layers received barrel cortex input within stereotyped dendritic domains. The cortico-cortical neurons in superﬁcial layers of motor cortex thus couple motor and sensory signals and might mediat		e sensorimotor integration and motor learning.},

	abstract = {Cerebellum and basal ganglia are reciprocally interconnected with the neocortex via oligosynaptic loops. The signal pathways of these loops predominantly converge in motor areas of the frontal cortex and are mainly segregated on subcortical level. Recent evidence, however, indicates subcortical interaction of these systems. We have reviewed literature that addresses the question whether, and to what extent, projections of main output nuclei of basal ganglia (reticular part of the substantia nigra, internal segment of the globus pallidus) and cerebellum (deep cerebellar nuclei) interact with each other in the thalamus. To this end, we compiled data from electrophysiological and anatomical studies in rats, cats, dogs, and non-human primates. Evidence suggests the existence of convergence of thalamic projections originating in basal ganglia and cerebellum, albeit sparse and restricted to certain regions. Four regions come into question to contain converging inputs: (1) lateral parts of medial dorsal 	nucleus ({MD}); (2) parts of anterior intralaminar nuclei and centromedian and parafascicular nuclei ({CM}/Pf); (3) ventromedial nucleus ({VM}); and (4) border regions of cerebellar and ganglia terminal territories in ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei ({VA}–{VL}). The amount of convergences was found to exhibit marked interspecies differences. To explain the rather sparse convergences of projection territories and to estimate their physiological relevance, we present two conceivable principles of anatomical organization: (1) a “core-and-shell” organization, in which a central core is exclusive to one projection system, while peripheral shell regions intermingle and occasionally converge with other projection systems and (2)convergences that are characteristic to distinct functional networks. The physiological relevance of these convergences is not yet clear. An oculomotor network proposed in this work is an interesting candidate to examine potential ganglia and cerebellar subcortical interactions},

Thus, inhibitory neurons migrate relatively long distances to reach their destination in the developing forebrain. The role of lineage in the organization and circuitry of interneurons is still not well understood. Utilizing a combination of genetics, retroviral fate mapping, and lineage-speciﬁc retroviral barcode labeling, we ﬁnd that clonally related interneurons can be widely dispersed while unrelated interneurons can be closely clustered. These data suggest that migratory mechanisms related to the clustering of interneurons occur largely independent of their clonal origin.},

	abstract = {The mouse is an increasingly prominent model for the analysis of mammalian neuronal circuits. Neural circuits ultimately have to be probed during behaviors that engage the circuits. Linking circuit dynamics to behavior requires precise control of sensory stimuli and measurement of body movements. Head-fixation has been used for behavioral research, particularly in non-human primates, to facilitate precise stimulus control, behavioral monitoring and neural recording. However, choicebased, perceptual decision tasks by head-fixed mice have only recently been introduced. Training mice relies on motivating mice using water restriction. Here we describe procedures for head-fixation, water restriction and behavioral training for head-fixed mice, with a focus on active, whisker-based tactile behaviors. In these experiments mice had restricted access to water (typically 1 ml/day). After ten days of water restriction, body weight stabilized at approximately 80\% of initial weight. At that point mice were t		rained to discriminate sensory stimuli using operant conditioning. Head-fixed mice reported stimuli by licking in go/no-go tasks and also using a forced choice paradigm using a dual lickport. In some cases mice learned to discriminate sensory stimuli in a few trials within the first behavioral session. Delay epochs lasting a second or more were used to separate sensation (e.g. tactile exploration) and action (i.e. licking). Mice performed a variety of perceptual decision tasks with high performance for hundreds of trials per behavioral session. Up to four months of continuous water restriction showed no adverse health effects. Behavioral performance correlated with the degree of water restriction, supporting the importance of controlling access to water. These behavioral paradigms can be combined with cellular resolution imaging, random access photostimulation, and whole cell recordings.},

Does information ﬂow sequentially from one cortical area to another, or do networks of interconnected areas contribute at the same time? Here we delineate when and how activity in speciﬁc areas drives a whisker-based decision in mice. A short-term memory component temporally separated tactile ‘‘sensation’’ and ‘‘action’’ (licking). Using optogenetic inhibition (spatial resolution, 2 mm; temporal resolution, 100 ms), we surveyed the neocortex for regions driving behavior during speciﬁc behavioral epochs. Barrel cortex was critical for sensation. During the short-term memory, unilateral inhibition of anterior lateral motor cortex biased responses to the ipsilateral side. Consistently, barrel cortex showed stimulus-speciﬁc activity during sensation, whereas motor cortex showed choice-speciﬁc preparatory activity and movement-related activity, consistent with roles in motor planning and movement. These results suggest serial information ﬂow 	from sensory to motor areas during perceptual decision making.},

	abstract = {Shifting between motor plans is often necessary for adaptive behavior. When faced with changing consequences of one’s actions, it is often imperative to switch from automatic actions to deliberative and controlled actions. The pre-supplementary motor area (pre-{SMA}) in primates, akin to the premotor cortex (M2) in mice, has been implicated in motor learning and planning, and action switching. We hypothesized that M2 would be differentially involved in goal-directed actions, which are controlled by their consequences vs. habits, which are more dependent on their past reinforcement history and less on their consequences. To investigate this, we performed M2 lesions in mice and then concurrently trained them to press the same lever for the same food reward using two different schedules of reinforcement that differentially bias towards the use of goal-directed versus habitual action strategies. We then probed whether actions were dependent on their expected consequence through outcome revaluation te	sting. We uncovered that M2 lesions did not affect the acquisition of lever-pressing. However, in mice with M2 lesions, lever-pressing was insensitive to changes in expected outcome value following goal-directed training. However, habitual actions were intact. We conﬁrmed a role for M2 in goal-directed but not habitual actions in separate groups of mice trained on the individual schedules biasing towards goal-directed versus habitual actions. These data indicate that M2 is critical for actions to be updated based on their consequences, and suggest that habitual action strategies may not require processing by M2 and the updating of motor plans.},

Recent evidence suggests, however, that it operates at a radically more complex level, coordinating behaviorally useful actions. Speciﬁc subregions of motor cortex may emphasize different ethologically relevant categories of behavior, such as interactions between the hand and the mouth, reaching motions, or defensive maneuvers to protect the body surface from impending impact. Single neurons in motor cortex may contribute to these behaviors by means of their broad tuning to idiosyncratic, multijoint actions. The mapping from cortex to muscles is not ﬁxed, as was once thought, but instead is ﬂuid, changing continuously on the basis of feedback in a manner that could support the control of higher-order movement parameters. These ﬁndings suggest that the motor cortex participates directly in organizing and controlling the animal’s behavioral repertoire.},

Cerebellar nuclei ({CN}) axons connect to various parts of the thalamo-cortical network, but detailed information on the characteristics of cerebello-thalamic connections is lacking. Here, we assessed the cerebellar input to the ventrolateral ({VL}), ventromedial ({VM}), and centrolateral ({CL}) thalamus. Confocal and electron microscopy showed an increased density and size of {CN} axon terminals in {VL} compared to {VM} or {CL}. Electrophysiological recordings in vitro revealed that optogenetic {CN} stimulation resulted in enhanced charge transfer and action potential ﬁring in {VL} neurons compared to {VM} or {CL} neurons, despite that the paired-pulse ratio was not signiﬁcantly different. Together, these ﬁndings indicate that the impact of {CN} input onto neurons of different thalamic nuclei varies substantially, which highlights the possibility that cerebellar output differentially controls various parts of the t	halamo-cortical network.},

Prior research has questioned whether the underlying coreinformation processing is different for the 2 variants of a task or whether they differ mostly in response demands. The authors examined 4 different diffusion models for the go/no-go variant of each task along with a standard diffusion model for the 2-choice variant (R. Ratcliff, 1978). The 2-choice and the go/no-go models were fit to data from 4 lexical decision experiments, 1 numerosity discrimination experiment, and 1 recognition memory experiment, each with 2-choice and go/no-go variants. The models that assumed an implicit decision criterion for no-go responses produced better fits than models that did not. The best model was one in which only response criteria and the nondecisional components of processing changed between the 2 variants, supporting the view that the core information on which decisions ar	e based is not different between them.},

	abstract = {When Hubel (1982) referred to layer 1 of primary visual cortex as “. . . a ‘crowning mystery’ to keep area-17 physiologists busy for years to come . . .” he could have been talking about any cortical area. In the 80’s and 90’s there were no methods to examine this neuropile on the surface of the cortex: a tangled web of axons and dendrites from a variety of different places with unknown speciﬁcities and doubtful connections to the cortical output neurons some hundreds of microns below. Recently, three changes have made the crowning enigma less of an impossible mission: the clear presence of neurons in layer 1 (L1), the active conduction of voltage along apical dendrites and optogenetic methods that might allow us to look at one source of input at a time. For all of those reasons alone, it seems it is time to take seriously the function of L1. The functional properties of this layer will need to wait for more experiments but already L1 cells are {GAD}67 positive, i.e., inhibitory! They could rever		se the sign of the thalamic glutamate ({GLU}) input for the entire cortex. It is at least possible that in the near future normal activity of individual sources of L1 could be detected using genetic tools. We are at the outset of important times in the exploration of thalamic functions and perhaps the solution to the crowning enigma is within sight. Our review looks forward to that solution from the solid basis of the anatomy of the basal ganglia output to motor thalamus. We will focus on L1, its afferents, intrinsic neurons and its inﬂuence on responses of pyramidal neurons in layers 2/3 and 5. Since L1 is present in the whole cortex we will provide a general overview considering evidence mainly from the somatosensory (S1) cortex before focusing on motor cortex.},

However, behavioral paradigms for mice lag behind those of primates, limiting the full potential of such tools. Here, we present an innovative behavioral framework in which head-ﬁxed mice directionally reach for water droplets, similar to the primate ‘‘center-out’’ reaching task. Mice rapidly engaged in the task, performed hundreds of trials, and reached in multiple directions when droplets were presented at different locations. Surprisingly, mice used chemosensation to determine the presence of water droplets. Optogenetic inactivation of the motor cortex halted the initiation and rapidly diverted the trajectory of ongoing movements. Layer 2/3 twophoton imaging revealed robust direction selectivity in most reach-related neurons. Finally, mice performed directional reaching instructed by vibratotactile stimuli, demonstrating the potential of this framewor	k for studying, in addition to motor control, sensory processing, and decision making.},

The activity of multiple molecularly deﬁned cell types was found to reﬂect this representation with type-speciﬁc dynamics. Focal optogenetic inhibition tiled across cortex revealed a crucial role for frontal cortex in triggering this cortex-wide phenomenon; local inhibition of this region blocked both the cortex-wide response to task-initiating cues and the voluntary behavior.

	abstract = {The ﬁeld of neuroanatomy has progressed considerably in recent decades, thanks to the emergence of novel methods which provide new insights into the organization of the nervous system. These new methods have produced a wealth of data that needs to be analyzed, shifting the bottleneck from the acquisition to the analysis of data. In other disciplines, such as in many engineering areas, scientists and engineers are dealing with increasingly complex systems, using hierarchical decompositions, graphical models and simpliﬁed schematic diagrams for analysis and design processes. This approach makes it possible for users to simultaneously combine global system views and very detailed representations of speciﬁc areas of interest, by selecting appropriate representations for each of these views. In this way, users can concentrate on speciﬁc details while also maintaining a general system overview — a capability that is essential for understanding structure and function whenever complexity is an issue. Fol	lowing this approach, this paper focuses on a graphical tool designed to help neuroanatomists to better understand and detect morphological characteristics of neuronal cells. The method presented here, based on a symbolic representation that can be tailored to enhance a particular range of features of a neuron or neuron set, has proven to be useful for highlighting particular geometries that may be hidden due to the complexity of the analysis tasks and the richness of neuronal morphologies. A software tool has been developed to generate graphical representations of neurons from 3D computer-aided reconstruction ﬁles.},

	abstract = {Karl Friston’s free energy minimization has been received with great enthusiasm. With good reason: it not only makes the bold claim to a unifying theory of the brain, but it is presented as an a priori principle applicable to living systems in general. In this article, we set out to show how the breadth of scope of Friston’s framework converges with the dialectics of Georg Hegel. Through an appeal to the work of Catherine Malabou, we aim to demonstrate how Friston not only reinvigorates Hegelian dialectics from the perspective of neuroscience, but that the implicit alignment with Hegel necessitates a reading of free energy minimization from the perspective of Hegel’s speculative philosophy. It is this reading that moves beyond the discussion between cognitivism and enactivism surrounding Friston’s framework; beyond the question whether the organism is a secluded entity separated from its surroundings, or whether it is a dynamical system characterized by perpetual openness and mutual exchange. Fro	m a Hegelian perspective, it is the tension between both positions itself that is operative at the level of the organism; as a contradiction the organism sustains over the course of its life. Not only does the organism’s secluded existence depend on a perpetual relation with its surroundings, but the condition for there to be such a relation is the existence of a secluded entity. We intend to show how this contradiction—tension internalized—is at the center of Friston’s anticipatory organism; how it is this contradiction that grounds the perpetual process of free energy minimization.},

We describe the signiﬁcant discoveries concerning the action of the spinal cord and cortex in motor phenomena during this period. This provides a vivid account of how great neuroscientists, over a period of more than 2000 years, have endeavoured to clarify notions concerning the integrative action of the nervous system in the context of the prevailing philosophical traditions of their times. We examine these traditions as well as the conceptual schemes offered by neuroscientists, especially in relation to the workings of the cortex. It is shown that neuroscientists cleave to this day to a tradition that goes back to Descartes, and that this is the case even for those who explicitly claim to reject such a tradition. The review conclu	des with what we take to be an appropriate basis for rejecting the Cartesian paradigm that we hope will assist neuroscientists in understanding the integrative action of the nervous system. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {The connections of prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) were investigated in the rat brain to determine the order and location of input and output connections to motor and somatosensory cortex. Retrograde (100 nl Fluoro-Gold) and anterograde (100 nl Biotinylated Dextran Amines, {BDA}; Fluorescein and Texas Red) neuronanatomical tracers were injected into the subdivisions of the {PFC} (prelimbic, ventral orbital, ventrolateral orbital, dorsolateral orbital) and their projections studied. We found clear evidence for organized input projections from the motor and somatosensory cortices to the {PFC}, with distinct areas of motor and cingulate cortex projecting in an ordered arrangement to the subdivisions of {PFC}. As injection location of retrograde tracer was moved from medial to lateral in {PFC}, we observed an ordered arrangement of projections occurring in sensory-motor cortex. There was a signiﬁcant effect of retrograde injection location on the position of labelled cells occurring in sensory-motor cortex 	(dorsoventral, anterior-posterior and mediolateral axes p {\textless} 0.001). The arrangement of output projections from {PFC} also displayed a signiﬁcant ordered projection to sensory-motor cortex (dorsoventral p {\textless} 0.001, anterior-posterior p = 0.002 and mediolateral axes p {\textless} 0.001). Statistical analysis also showed that the locations of input and output labels vary with respect to one another (in the dorsal-ventral and medial-lateral axes, p {\textless} 0.001). Taken together, the ﬁndings show that regions of {PFC} display an ordered arrangement of connections with sensory-motor cortex, with clear laminar organization of input connections. These results also show that input and output connections to {PFC} are not located in exactly the same sites and reveal a circuit between sensory-motor and {PFC}.},

In addition, several sites were encountered where more than one movement was elicited at the same stimulus threshold. The locations of pyramidal cells contributing axons to the pyramidal tract were examined by means of retrograde tracing with {HRP} injected into the cervical enlargement. This procedure labeled neurons only in lamina V in granular and agranular cortical fields.

	abstract = {The axonal arborization of single motor thalamic neurons was examined in rat brain using a viral vector expressing membranetargeted palmitoylation site-attached green ﬂuorescent protein ({palGFP}). We ﬁrst divided the ventral anterior-ventral lateral motor thalamic nuclei into 1) the rostromedial portion, which was designated inhibitory afferent-dominant zone ({IZ}) with intense glutamate decarboxylase immunoreactivity and weak vesicular glutamate transporter 2 immunoreactivity, and 2) the caudolateral portion, named excitatory subcortical afferent-dominant zone ({EZ}) with the reversed immunoreactivity proﬁle. We then labeled 38 motor thalamic neurons in 29 hemispheres by injecting a diluted {palGFP}-Sindbis virus solution and isolated 10 {IZ} and {EZ} neurons for reconstruction. All the reconstructed {IZ} neurons widely projected not only to the cerebral cortex but also to the neostriatum, whereas the {EZ} neurons sent axons almost exclusively to the cortex. More interestingly, 47--66\% of axon 	varicosities of {IZ} neurons were observed in layer I of cortical areas. In contrast, only 2--15\% of varicosities of {EZ} neurons were found in layer I, most varicosities being located in middle layers. These results suggest that 2 forms of information from the basal ganglia and cerebellum are differentially supplied to apical and basal dendrites, respectively, of cortical pyramidal neurons and integrated to produce a motor execution command.},

	abstract = {Motor thalamic nuclei, ventral anterior ({VA}), ventral lateral ({VL}) and ventral medial ({VM}) nuclei, receive massive glutamatergic and {GABAergic} afferents from the cerebellum and basal ganglia, respectively. In the present study, these afferents were characterized with immunoreactivities for glutamic acid decarboxylase of 67 {kDa} ({GAD}67) and vesicular glutamate transporter ({VGluT})2, and examined by combining immunocytochemistry with the anterograde axonal labeling and neuronal depletion methods in the rat brain. {VGluT}2 immunoreactivity was intense in the caudodorsal portion of the {VA}-{VL}, whereas {GAD}67 immunoreactivity was abundant in the {VM} and rostroventral portion of the {VA}-{VL}. The rostroventral {VA}-{VL} and {VM} contained two types of {GAD}67-immunopositive varicosities (large and small), but the caudodorsal {VA}-{VL} comprised small ones alone. {VGluT}2-immunopositive varicosities were much larger in the caudodorsal {VA}-{VL} than those in the rostroventral {VA}-{VL} 	and {VM}. When anterograde tracers were injected into the basal ganglia output nuclei, the vast majority of labeled axon varicosities were large and distributed in the rostroventral {VA}-{VL} and {VM}, showing immunoreactivity for {GAD}67, but not for {VGluT}2. Only the large {GAD}67-immunopositive varicosities were mostly abolished by kainic acid depletion of substantia nigra neurons. In contrast, large to giant axon varicosities derived from the deep cerebellar nuclei were distributed mostly in the caudodorsal {VA}-{VL}, displaying {VGluT}2 immunoreactivity. The {VGluT}2-positive varicosities disappeared from the core portion of the caudodorsal {VA}-{VL} by depletion of cerebellar nucleus neurons. Thus, complementary distributions of large {VGluT}2- and {GAD}67-positive terminals in the motor thalamic nuclei are considered to reﬂect glutamatergic cerebellar and {GABAergic} basal ganglia afferents, respectively.},

Previous studies demonstrate two L5 pyramid types: cortico-cortical ({CC}) and cortico-subcortical ({CS}). We characterize connectivity and function of these cell types in mouse primary visual cortex and reveal a new subtype. Unlike previously described L5 {CC} and {CS} neurons, this new subtype does not project to striatum [cortico-cortical, non-striatal ({CC}-{NS})] and has distinct morphology, physiology, and visual responses. Monosynaptic rabies tracing reveals that {CC} neurons preferentially receive input from higher visual areas, while {CS} neurons receive more input from structures implicated in top-down modulation of brain states. {CS} neurons are also more directionselective and prefer faster stimuli than {CC} neurons. These differences suggest distinct roles as specialized output channels, with {CS} neurons integrating information and generating resp	onses more relevant to movement control and {CC} neurons being more important in visual perception.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Different neuron types serve distinct roles in neural processing. Extracellular electrical recordings are extensively used to study brain function but are typically blind to cell identity. Morpho-electric properties of neurons measured on spatially dense electrode arrays might be useful for distinguishing neuron types. Here we used Neuropixels probes to record from cortical and subcortical regions of the mouse brain. Extracellular waveforms of each neuron were detected across many channels and showed distinct spatiotemporal profiles among brain regions. Classification of neurons by brain region was improved with multi-channel compared to single-channel waveforms. In visual cortex, waveform clustering identified the canonical regular spiking ({RS}) and fast spiking ({FS}) classes, but also uncovered a subclass of {RS} units with unidirectional backpropagating action potentials ({BAPs}). Moreover, {BAPs} were observed in many hippocampal {RS} cells. Overall, waveform analysis of spikes from high-densi	ty probes aids neuron identification and can reveal dendritic backpropagation.},

Over 600 labeled neuronal pathways acquired from tracer injections placed across the entire mouse neocortex enabled us to generate a cortical connectivity atlas. A total of 240 intracortical connections were manually reconstructed within a common neuroanatomic framework, forming a cortico-cortical connectivity map that facilitates comparison of connections from different cortical targets. Connectivity matrices were generated to provide an overview of all intracortical connections and subnetwork clusterings. The connectivity matrices and cortical map revealed that the entire cortex is organized into four somatic sensorimotor, two medial, and two lateral subnetworks that display unique topologies and can interact through select cortical areas. Together, these data provide a reso	urce that can be used to further investigate cortical networks and their corresponding functions.},

However, it remains unclear how this process is adaptively regulated according to contextual changes on diﬀerent timescales. To address the issue, we used an improved stop-signal task paradigm to behaviorally and electrophysiologically characterize the temporal aspect of proactive inhibition in head-ﬁxed rats. In the task, they must respond to a go cue as quickly as possible (go trial), but did not have to respond if a stop cue followed the go cue (stop trial). The task alternated between a block of only go trials (G-block) and a block of go-and-stop trials ({GS}-block). We observed block-based and trial-based proactive inhibition (emerging in {GS}-block and after stop trial, respectively) by behaviorally evaluating the delay in reaction time in correct go trials depending on conte	xtual changes on diﬀerent timescales. We electrophysiologically analyzed task-related neuronal activity in the primary and secondary motor, posterior parietal, and orbitofrontal cortices (M1, M2, {PPC}, and {OFC}, respectively). Under block-based proactive inhibition, spike activity of cue-preferring {OFC} neurons was attenuated continuously, while M1 and M2 activity was enhanced during motor preparation. Subsequently, M1 activity was attenuated during motor decision/execution. Under trial-based proactive inhibition, the {OFC} activity was continuously enhanced, and {PPC} and M1 activity was also enhanced shortly during motor decision/execution. These results suggest that diﬀerent cortical mechanisms underlie the two types of proactive inhibition in rodents. Ó 2018 {IBRO}. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The dynamical systems view of movement generation in motor cortical areas has emerged as an effective way to explain the ﬁring properties of populations of neurons recorded from these regions. Recently, many studies have focused on ﬁnding low-dimensional representations of these dynamical systems during voluntary reaching and grasping behaviors carried out by the forelimbs. One such model, the Poisson linear-dynamical-system ({PLDS}) model, has been shown to extract dynamics which can be used to decode reaching kinematics. However, few have investigated these dynamics, especially in non-human primates, during behaviors such as locomotion, which may involve motor cortex to a lesser degree. Here, we focused on unconstrained quadrupedal locomotion, and investigated whether unsupervised latent state-space models can extract low-dimensional dynamics while preserving information about hind-limb kinematics. Spiking activity from the leg area of primary motor cortex of rhesus macaques was recorded simult		aneously with hind-limb joint positions during ambulation across a corridor, ladder, and on a treadmill at various speeds. We found that {PLDS} models can extract stereotyped low-dimensional neural trajectories from these neurons phase-locked to the gait cycle, and that distinct trajectories emerge depending on the speed and class of behavior. Additionally, it was possible to decode both the hind-limb kinematics and the gait phase from these inferred trajectories just as well or better than from the full neural population (18-80 neurons) with only 12 dimensions. Our results demonstrate that kinematics and gait phase during various locomotion tasks are well represented in low-dimensional latent dynamics inferred from motor cortex population activity.},

	abstract = {Summary
          Cognitive capacities afford contingent associations between sensory information and behavioral responses. We studied this problem using an olfactory delayed match to sample task whereby a sample odor specifies the association between a subsequent test odor and rewarding action. Multi-neuron recordings revealed representations of the sample and test odors in olfactory sensory and association cortex, which were sufficient to identify the test odor as match/non-match. Yet, inactivation of a downstream premotor area ({ALM}), but not orbitofrontal cortex, confined to the epoch preceding the test odor, led to gross impairment. Olfactory decisions that were not context dependent were unimpaired. Therefore, {ALM} may not receive the outcome of a match/non-match decision from upstream areas but contextual information—the identity of the sample—to establish the mapping between test odor and action. A novel population of pyramidal neurons in {ALM} layer 2 may mediate this process.},

Although many studies have assumed that motor cortex encodes direction in an extrinsic, Cartesian ({CA}) coordinate system, other studies have provided evidence for encoding in intermediate coordinate systems such as a shoulder-centered ({SC}) or in a purely intrinsic, joint-angle-based ({JA}) coordinate frame. By simultaneously recording from multiple single units in primary motor cortex, we examined movement direction encoding under each of these three coordinate systems. We directly compared the degree of directional tuning invariance over multiple sub-regions in the workspace. We also compared the mutual information between neuronal ﬁring rate and movement direction in the three systems. We observed a broad range of directional invariance in all three coordinate systems with no strong dominance of any single coordinate system. The mutual in		formation analyses corroborated this observation. However, we found a small but signiﬁcant bias toward the {SC} coordinate frame, which was also supported by population vector decoding. Similar results were found when we compared hand/torque force direction encoding in all three coordinate systems. These results suggest that the motor cortex employs a coordinate system that is yet to be discovered or perhaps that the motor cortex should not be viewed as a substrate for any coordinate system representation.},

Most research of this kind has focused on reactive control—that is, how subjects stop a response outright when instructed by a signal. It is argued that reactive paradigms are limited as models of control relevant to psychiatry. Instead, a set of paradigms is advocated that begins to model proactive inhibitory control—that is, how a subject prepares to stop an upcoming response tendency. Proactive inhibitory control is generated according to the goals of the subject rather than by an external signal, and it can be selectively targeted at a particular response tendency. This may have wider validity than reactive control as 	an experimental model for stopping inappropriate responses.},

Further, for unilateral activity changes in the {BG}, a lateralized eﬀect on contralateral movements can be expected due to ipsilateral thalamocortical connectivity. However, a direct test of these outcomes of thalamic inhibition has not been performed. To conduct such a direct test, we utilized rapid optogenetic activation and inactivation of the {GABAergic} output of the substantia nigra pars reticulata ({SNr}) to {MT} in male and female mice that were trained in a sensory cued left/right licking task. Directional licking tasks have previously been shown to depend on a thalamocortical feedback loop between ventromedial {MT} and antero-lateral premotor cortex. In conﬁrmation of model predictions, we found that unilateral optogenetic inhibition of {GABAergic} output from the {SNr}, during ipsilaterally 	cued trials, biased decision making towards a contralateral lick without aﬀecting motor performance. In contrast, optogenetic excitation of {SNr} terminals in {MT} resulted in an opposite bias towards the ipsilateral direction conﬁrming a bidirectional eﬀect of tonic nigral output on directional decision making. However, direct optogenetic excitation of neurons in the {SNr} resulted in bilateral movement suppression, which is in agreement with previous results that show such suppression for nigral terminals in the superior colliculus ({SC}), which receives a bilateral projection from {SNr}.

In the present paper, ﬁrst we used a simple reaction ({RT}) time task and, second, we took advantage of the fact that volitional inhibition is usually implemented before any stimulus occurs when subjects are aware that a warning signal will be presented before a target. This proactive inhibition would be intended to prevent anticipated responses and would be lifted as soon as the warning signal has been identiﬁed. In other words, we postulate that the same event does not trigger 	both inhibition and target processing, and that, indeed, these mechanisms can be separated in time. Event-related {fMRI} revealed that the medial prefrontal cortex and the inferior parietal cortex may be responsible for proactive inhibition, and that the primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor cortex and the putamen are the likely targeted sites of this inhibition. We conclude that executive control in these tasks may consist of switching from controlled inhibition (suppression of the neuronal processes underlying movement initiation) to automatic sensorimotor processing. The possible contribution of the medial prefrontal cortex to the tonic inhibition state adds new perspectives to possible meanings of a “default mode of brain function”.},

	abstract = {Refraining from reacting does not only involve reactive inhibitory mechanisms. It was recently found that inhibitory control also relies strongly on proactive mechanisms. However, since most available studies have focused on reactive stopping, little is known about how proactive inhibition of response is implemented. Two behavioral experiments were conducted to identify the temporal dynamics of this executive function. They manipulated respectively the time during which inhibitory control must be sustained until a stimulus occurs, and the time limit allowed to set up inhibition before a stimulus occurs. The results show that inhibitory control is not set up after but before instruction, and is not transient and sporadic but sustained across time. Consistent with our previous neuroimaging ﬁndings, these results suggest that proactive inhibition of response is the default mode of executive control. This implies that top-down control of sensorimotor reactivity would consist of a temporary release (u	p to several seconds), when appropriate (when the environment becomes predictable), of the default locking state.This conclusion is discussed with regard to current anatomo-functional models of inhibitory control, and to methodological features of studies of attention and sensorimotor control.},

Two hypotheses consider either inhibition of thalamic activity or thalamic excitation via post-inhibitory rebound burst ﬁring as the functional mode of this link. We used optogenetics to characterize the synaptic properties of nigral input to motor thalamus in adult mouse brain slices, and to determine in what conditions the nigral inhibition of motor thalamus is transmitted via inhibition or rebound ﬁring. Our results are more consistent with graded inhibition of spiking for conditions expected in normal awake animals, because inhibitory potentials from nigral input were generally not sufﬁcient to elicit rebound spikes when the thalamic neurons were actively ﬁring. However, with bursty or fast trains of nigral input low-threshold rebound spike bursts could be triggered for low levels of excitation. This may form the basis of path	ological burst generation and transmission in parkinsonian conditions.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present an approach to the identiﬁcation of nonlinear input–state– output systems. By using a bilinear approximation to the dynamics of interactions among states, the parameters of the implicit causal model reduce to three sets. These comprise (1) parameters that mediate the inﬂuence of extrinsic inputs on the states, (2) parameters that mediate intrinsic coupling among the states, and (3) [bilinear] parameters that allow the inputs to modulate that coupling. Identiﬁcation proceeds in a Bayesian framework given known, deterministic inputs and the observed responses of the system. We developed this approach for the analysis of effective connectivity using experimentally designed inputs and {fMRI} responses. In this context, the coupling parameters correspond to effective connectivity and the bilinear parameters reﬂect the changes in connectivity induced by inputs. The ensuing framework allows one to characterise {fMRI} experiments, conceptually, as an experimental manipulation of 	integration among brain regions (by contextual or trial-free inputs, like time or attentional set) that is revealed using evoked responses (to perturbations or trial-bound inputs, like stimuli). As with previous analyses of effective connectivity, the focus is on experimentally induced changes in coupling (cf., psychophysiologic interactions). However, unlike previous approaches in neuroimaging, the causal model ascribes responses to designed deterministic inputs, as opposed to treating inputs as unknown and stochastic.},

Furthermore, if we look closely at what is optimized, the same quantity keeps emerging, namely value (expected reward, expected utility) or its complement, surprise (prediction error, expected cost).

A critical analysis of data, collected in collaboration with Simon Brailowsky, with chronic {GABA} infusion is presented, together with an illustration of data obtained with muscimol-induced inactivation.},
